You seem to sever all my frequencies\
I'm tethered to your energies
<!--more-->
And everything turns inside out\
I can't be killed but I'm not too proud

All this is making things a bit insane\
And I don't care who stares or stays\
The only thing that matters is\
Will you reach out if you can't resist?
