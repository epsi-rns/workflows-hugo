Did you know that the original name for Pac-Man was Puck-Man?

<!--more-->

You'd think it was because he looks like a hockey puck
but it actually comes from the Japanese phrase 'Paku-Paku,'
which means to flap one's mouth open and closed.
They changed it because they thought
Puck-Man would be too easy to vandalize,
you know, like people could just scratch off the P
and turn it into an F or whatever.
